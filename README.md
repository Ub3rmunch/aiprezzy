# AI Workflow Levels - Interactive Visualization

A Mario-style interactive presentation demonstrating 5 levels of AI workflow adoption for software engineers, from manual processes to AI-powered automation.

## Overview

This visualization shows how software engineering workflows evolve as teams adopt AI tools more effectively. Watch Mario navigate through different tools (Jira, Confluence, Figma, Xcode, Simulator, Tests, Git, GitHub, Slack, and AI) to understand the impact of various AI integration approaches.

## The 5 Levels

1. **Level 1: No AI - Pure Manual** (8-10 iteration cycles)
   - Traditional workflow with all manual processes
   - Extensive back-and-forth between tools
   - Multiple testing and debugging cycles

2. **Level 2: Copy/Paste AI** (6-7 cycles)
   - Basic AI usage with copy-paste workflows
   - Some reduction in iterations
   - Still mostly manual process

3. **Level 3: Inefficient (WORST!)** (too much switching)
   - Excessive context switching between AI and other tools
   - Interrupts flow and concentration
   - Often slower than Level 2

4. **Level 4: Efficient AI** (2-3 cycles)
   - AI gets full context upfront
   - Minimal interruptions
   - Significant reduction in iteration cycles

5. **Level 5: God Mode** (AI does everything)
   - AI handles most of the workflow
   - Minimal manual intervention
   - Just review and approval

## Features

- **Interactive Animation**: Watch Mario progress through each workflow level
- **Contextual Thoughts**: See Mario's inner monologue showing realistic developer experiences
- **Visual Metrics**: Score, time, and iteration count for each level
- **Educational Slides**: Key takeaways about AI workflow mistakes and best practices

## Key Learnings

The presentation highlights common mistakes in AI adoption:

1. **Tools, Not Context** - Switching models constantly instead of providing context
2. **Not Using Claude Code** - Missing out on terminal access, parallelization, and planning mode
3. **No Feedback Loop** - Developer remains the testing bottleneck instead of AI testing
4. **Copy/Paste Workflow** - Not using MCPs for direct tool integration
5. **Jump to Code** - Starting implementation without planning first

## Technology Stack

- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons
- Interactive keyboard controls

## Getting Started

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for setup and development instructions.

## Controls

- **SPACEBAR**: Play/Pause animation
- **LEFT/RIGHT ARROWS**: Switch between levels
- **ENTER**: View educational slides
- **ESC**: Return to game from slides

## Project Context

This visualization was created to demonstrate the importance of:
- Proper AI context management
- Using agentic tools (like Claude Code)
- Establishing feedback loops
- Direct tool integration via MCPs
- Planning before implementation

The goal is to help engineering teams move from Level 1 (no AI) through the inefficient Level 3, and ultimately reach Level 4 (efficient AI) or Level 5 (God Mode).
